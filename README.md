# clockwork2_d2hw_mr63_mod
CW2 (V1 body) extruder D2HW mod (SB Board not supported; potentially niche)

Warning - I am not great at CAD, you probably know more than me/are better. 
If someone wants to re-make this properly, feel free to! 
I am sharing because this worked well for me and I think people may appreciate the pre-done effort. 

Inspiration:
I had some issues with he ball bearing and the D2F switch on my clockwork 2 extruder. The MR63 bearing + D2HW are super reliable in the BT extruders.
I was inspired by and re-used some assets from the Galileo 2 D2HW Mod. https://github.com/Ntrondle/Galileo2_D2HW/tree/main

I loaded up the cad models for the Galileo2 D2HW and the V1 CW2 body and added in the MR63ZZ bearing and the D2HW microswitch.

I added some meat to the edge of the compartment where the SB board would normally site to better mount the D2HW Switch. If you add in some standoffs, you might still be able to fit the board. IDK though.

I am attaching the step file, and the stl file.
The SHAPR3D file is too big for git though. Sorry.
